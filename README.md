**Tableau Covid-Death Dashboard**

In this Tableau Covid-Death Dashboard project offers a comprehensive analysis of global Covid-19 data, presenting vital insights into the pandemic's impact on different regions and populations. This visualization project leverages Tableau's powerful tools to visualize COVID-19 statistics, focusing on key metrics like total cases, total deaths, and death percentages for locations as well as continents.


Using a series of meticulously crafted SQL queries, this visualization project meticulously aggregates and presents data from the PortfolioProject database. It calculates total cases and deaths, providing valuable context for understanding the pandemic's severity in various areas.

Additionally, my Tableau Covid-Death Dashboard delves into more granular details, allowing users to explore the highest infection counts and the percentage of the population infected for each location. By filtering the data to focus on specific countries like India, the United States, China, and the United Kingdom, users can gain a deeper understanding of how the pandemic has affected these nations over time.

This project not only provides valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic but also showcases the power of Tableau and SQL in transforming complex data into visually informative dashboards. 

Explore the interactive dashboard to uncover trends, disparities, and patterns in COVID-19 data that have shaped our world over the past years.
